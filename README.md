# Text_Cleaning

Used Python NLTK library to eliminate punctuations, numbers and standard stop words. 

In order to make the clustering words to be more meaningful, we also customize some stop words such as “claim”, 
“application”, “issue”. We chose Snowball stemming algorithm to combine the different words with the same meaning into 
the same word
